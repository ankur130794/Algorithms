This section contains code of few of the most used and famous problems which can are solved more efficiently by using Dynamic Programming.
The 2 basic criteria for deciding if a problem is needed to be soled using DP are:
1) Overlapping Subproblems
2) Optimal Substructure

All of the codes contain one sample test case to run. For better understanding of the algorithms I personally felt the video guides of
Tushar Roy to be sufficient. You can watch them here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrmLmBdmIlpsHaNTPP_jHHDx_os9ItYXr

You can also debug the code to understand the flow.
